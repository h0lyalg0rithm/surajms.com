Recently I started an online course on shawacademy.I signed up for the Professional Diploma in Sports Nutrition.
The course is split into four modules and its taught by Amanda Broderick, who seemed to have a lot of knowledge in Sports Nutrition.


The first lession was titled **"What Fuels Energy Systems"**

My goal was to learn about Nutrition as I was sick of all the martketing gimmick around.

Nutrition comes from the word *nourish* which means to feed, nurse, support and preserve.

Week 1: Energy System and Carbohydrates

Week 2: Proteins, Fats, and Hydration.

Week 3: Supplements and Nutrient Timing

Week 4: Mastering Strategies for Wright Loss and Muscle Gain

Week 5: Mastering Energy Metabolism

Week 6: Mastering Fats

Week 7: Mastering CArbohydrates

Week 8: Mastering Proteins

Week 9: The Endurance athelete

Week 10: The Strength Athelete

Week 11: Team Sports

Week 12: Competition Preparation and Recovery

Week 13: Specialised Diets in Sports

Week 14: Mastering Suppements  and Micronutrients

Week 15: Nutrition for injury and illness

Week 16: Delivering effective advice


Each individual needs are different and should to tailored to ones personal needs.

## Benefits of Good Sports Nutrition

- Refuels Energy stores
- Helps reach your weight loss/gain taargets
- Boosts immune system
- Improves performance
- Enhances concentration levels
- Delays fatigue
- Protects against injury
- Fights and helps to prevent disease



## Carbohydrates
 - Energy
 - Principal source of energy
 - Most important fuel for excercise
 - Stored as glycogen in liver and muscles
 - Maintain blood glucose levels
 - Dietary energy 4 kcal/g (17KJ)


## Fats
 - Supply fuel for cells - 9 Kcals/g (38KJ)
 - Energy dense
 - Acts as a carrier for fat soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) and antioxidants
 - Insulate the body and provide energy
 - Protective layer for organs
 - Form brain tissues nerves cell membrane

## Protein
 - Growth and repair of tissues and cells
 - Enzymatic function - all enxymes are protiens
 - Hormonal function - eg insulin
 - Buffering function - maintain pH balance of blood
 - Energy 4kcal/g (17KJ)

## Energy systems
### ATP - Adenosine Tri-Phosphate
Energy is produced by splitting phosphate group
3/4 energy is given off as heat

### ATP-PC System
Provides energy for brief periods
 - Short sprint
 - Single jump
 - Weight lift

### Anaerobic Glycolysis
 - Activates in high intensity activity
 - Lasts approximately 90 seconds
 - Energy is produced by breaking down glucose

![Anaerobic](/wp-contents/uploads/2019/08/anaerobic_atp.png)


### Aerobic Metabolism
 - 20% more efficient than Anaerobic
 - Uses carbohydreates and fats as ffule
 - Produces large amounts of energy

#### Physical Fitness
Its the ability to carry out tasks without undue fatigue  
Overall fitness is made up of five main components:

 - Cardiorespiratory Endurance
 - Endurance
 - Strength
 - Body composition
 - Flexibility

#### Ideal Physical Acitivty : 18 - 64 years
 - 150 minutes of moderate aerobic physical activity
 - 300 for more benefit
 - Muscle strengthening activities atleast twice a week.

| Level    | Intensity |
|----------|-----------|
| light    | No noticeable change in breathing pattern |
| moderate | Breathing is deep and more frequent.You can carry on a conversation but not sing |
| high     | Will break a sweat in 3-5 minutes.Rapid and deep breathing.You cna only talk in short phrases |
