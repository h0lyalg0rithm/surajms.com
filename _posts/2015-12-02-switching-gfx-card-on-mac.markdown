Recently I bought an old mac from my friend.This mac is pretty old, it has two GFX cards one integrated and one discrete.Switching the cards was really important since the machine would heat up while using the dedicated GPU.

I found this tool online on [gfx.io](https://gfx.io/).This tool lets me easily switch the GPU using a statusbar application.
