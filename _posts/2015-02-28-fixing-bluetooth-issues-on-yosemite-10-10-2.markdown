Lately I have been having issues with my macbook 13in retina 2013.The bluetooth on the mac doesnt connect to any device.After trying a lot of things this is the only solution that worked for me.

    
    sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.blued.plist
    sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.blued.plist


I guess this turns off the bluetooth deviceÂ deamon/agent and voila bluetooth now works.
