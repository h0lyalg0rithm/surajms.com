I am really crazy about the concept of time travel not regular travel(I hate travelling where the weather is bad).By writing this blog i have actually done some sort of time travel or something close to it.

Now you might me wondering what I was talking about.Thats where the crazy inception comes along.The inception here is the blog post.
For me blog posts are a way of reminding the future me on how to get things done.I might have learnt about something of utter importance a year ago and due to the way my brain functions ,my long term memory is pretty crap without exercise.

This post a note for myself in the future.
