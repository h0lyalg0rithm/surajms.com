Its been about two months since i sat down to write a blog post.Just like my dieting there are always highs and lows.Now that the 5 projects are done with I can return safely to my computer and type away.

Usually when I am on a diet I would start the week off with high hopes and energy not consuming those awesome delicacies on my way home.But as the week passes by I would revert back to my old habits and eating out of control. 
The same happens when I start blogging ,it starts of with a couple of posts every week and as work piles up I stop writing and that ends up i this lonely graveyard i call my blog.

So this time I will make it an habit to write atleast one post every week.
