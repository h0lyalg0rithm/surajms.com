Last week on saturday I had participated in the dec0de hackathon with my friend.Unlike previous hackathon that I took part in.I had an idea in mind days before the hackathon.All that was left was implementing it during the hackathon.

The idea was pretty straight forward, it was a mobile app that tracks the transaction from different bank accounts through the SMS that it receives after every transaction.

Here is the presentation:

{% raw %}
<script class="speakerdeck-embed" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js" async="" data-id="315b65fb1d1746cea4b2b0b5641cd77e" data-ratio="1.33333333333333"></script>
{% endraw %}

After thinking about it for a while, I realized that it was a combination of the presentation and the idea that made us win first place at the hackathon.
