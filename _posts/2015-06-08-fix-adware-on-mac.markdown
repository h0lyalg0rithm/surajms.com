Today one of the startups in our accelerator were infected with an adware.After some digging around it looked like the adware has infected the whole system not just the browser.Chrome, Safari and even Firefox were infected.

After a couple of Google searches I came across [Adware Medic](http://www.adwaremedic.com).Its a free , donation driven application which working detects adware using signatures similar to antivirus.

The application was very easy to use and within a couple of minutes the application detected all the files that were infected and cleaned it.

The application is highly recommended even for those who are yet to be infected by malware.
