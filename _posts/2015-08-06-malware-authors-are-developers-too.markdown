Last week my colleague at [TURN8](http://turn8.co) informed me that his browser was infected with adware.

As eminent from the previous [blog post](http://surajms.com/2015/06/fix-adware-on-mac/) Adware Medic came right to my mind.

So i launched adware medic and it immediately detected the malware in the ` /Users/username/Library/ScriptingAdditions ` .There was folder which contained the malware waiting for me to delete and delete it just what I did.

But after a couple of minutes my colleague asked me I got rid of the malware.So I took a look at the folder and the malware had somehow restored itself.<!-- more -->


Whenever Safari would launch it would restore the folder to its original state.After trying the same thing a couple of times I decided to do something stupid.

I launched the terminal and changed the owner of the directory from my colleague's user to root.This immediately stopped the malware insight.

Then I realized that the malware author were developers just like us.They trip and fall just like us.
