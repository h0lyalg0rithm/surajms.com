Toro is simple PHP Router that has beautiful & minimalistic syntax.Its just 125 linesÂ of php.

Building a rest client is as pretty simple.All one has to do is require the library and set up the routes.You may ask me whats the difference between Toro and other routing framework.To that I will say there are many.First the code is so simple and clean(a daunting when using PHP).The API it provides are simple and straight forward as well with minimal setup requirements.It also includes pre & post hooks.

To setup a basic route one has to do the following

{% raw %}

{% endraw %}
